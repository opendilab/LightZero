Overview:
    Adapt the connect4 environment in PettingZoo (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) to the BaseEnv interface.
    Connect Four is a 2-player turn based game, where players must connect four of their tokens vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 
    The players drop their respective token in a column of a standing grid, where each token will fall until it reaches the bottom of the column or reaches an existing token. 
    Players cannot place a token in a full column, and the game ends when either a player has made a sequence of 4 tokens, or when all 7 columns have been filled.
Mode:
    - ``self_play_mode``: In ``self_play_mode``, two players take turns to play. This mode is used in AlphaZero for data generating.
    - ``play_with_bot_mode``: In this mode, the environment has a bot inside, which take the role of player 2. So the player may play against the bot.
Bot:
    - MCTSBot: A bot which take action through a Monte Carlo Tree Search, which has a high performance.
    - RuleBot: A bot which take action according to some simple settings, which has a moderate performance. Note: Currently the RuleBot can only exclude actions that would lead to losing the game within three moves. 
        Note: Currently the RuleBot can only exclude actions that would lead to losing the game within three moves. One possible improvement is to further enhance the bot's long-term planning capabilities.
Observation Space:
    The observation in the Connect4 environment is a dictionary with five elements, which contains key information about the current state. 
    - observation (:obj:`array`): An array that represents information about the current state, with a shape of (3, 6, 7). 
        The length of the first dimension is 3, which stores three two-dimensional game boards with shapes (6, 7).
        These boards represent the positions occupied by the current player, the positions occupied by the opponent player, and the identity of the current player, respectively.
    - action_mask (:obj:`array`): A mask for the actions, indicating which actions are executable. It is a one-dimensional array of length 7, corresponding to columns 1 to 7 of the game board. 
        It has a value of 1 for the columns where a move can be made, and a value of 0 for other positions.
    - board (:obj:`array`): A visual representation of the current game board, represented as a 6x7 array, in which the positions where player 1 and player 2 have placed their tokens are marked with values 1 and 2, respectively. 
    - current_player_index (:obj:`int`): The index of the current player, with player 1 having an index of 0 and player 2 having an index of 1. 
    - to_play (:obj:`int`): The player who needs to take an action in the current state, with a value of 1 or 2.
Action Space:
    A set of integers from 0 to 6 (inclusive), where the action represents which column a token should be dropped in.
Reward Space:
    For the ``self_play_mode``, a reward of 1 is returned at the time step when the game terminates, and a reward of 0 is returned at all other time steps.
    For the ``play_with_bot_mode``, at the time step when the game terminates, if the bot wins, the reward is -1; if the agent wins, the reward is 1; and in all other cases, the reward is 0.
