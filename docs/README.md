# üé® Welcome to LightZero Docs

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lightzero-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://lightzero-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

[LightZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08348.pdf) is a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-understand open-source algorithm toolkit that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL).

The LightZero documentation can be found [here](https://opendilab.github.io/LightZero/). It contains tutorials and the API reference.

For those interested in customizing environments and algorithms, we provide relevant guides:
