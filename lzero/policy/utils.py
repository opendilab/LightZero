def negative_cosine_similarity(x1, x2):

    Overview:
        consistency loss function: the negative cosine similarity.
    Arguments:
        - x1 (:obj:`torch.Tensor`): shape (batch_size, dim), e.g. (256, 512)
        - x2 (:obj:`torch.Tensor`): shape (batch_size, dim), e.g. (256, 512)
    Returns:
        (x1 * x2).sum(dim=1) is the cosine similarity between vector x1 and x2.
        The cosine similarity always belongs to the interval [-1, 1].
        For example, two proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1,
        two orthogonal vectors have a similarity of 0,
        and two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1.
         -(x1 * x2).sum(dim=1) is consistency loss, i.e. the negative cosine similarity.
