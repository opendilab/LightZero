"""
Overview:
    This code implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm with the integration of neural networks. 
    The Node class represents a node in the Monte Carlo tree and implements the basic functionalities expected in a node. 
    The MCTS class implements the specific search functionality and provides the optimal action through the ``get_next_action`` method. 
    Compared to traditional MCTS, the introduction of value networks and policy networks brings several advantages.
    During the expansion of nodes, it is no longer necessary to explore every single child node, but instead, 
    the child nodes are directly selected based on the prior probabilities provided by the neural network. 
    This reduces the breadth of the search. When estimating the value of leaf nodes, there is no need for a rollout; 
    instead, the value output by the neural network is used, which saves the depth of the search.

            UCB = Q(s,a) + P(s,a) \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{N(\text{parent})}}{1+N(\text{child})} \cdot \left(c_1 + \log\left(\frac{N(\text{parent})+c_2+1}{c_2}\right)\right)
            - Q(s,a): value of a child node.
            - P(s,a): The prior of a child node.
            - N(parent): The number of the visiting of the parent node.
            - N(child): The number of the visiting of the child node.
            - c_1: a parameter given by self._pb_c_init to control the influence of the prior P(s,a) relative to the value Q(s,a).
            - c_2: a parameter given by self._pb_c_base to control the influence of the prior P(s,a) relative to the value Q(s,a).
        Arguments:
            - parent (:obj:`Class Node`): Current node.
            - child (:obj:`Class Node`): Current node's child.
        Returns:
            - score (:obj:`Bool`): The UCB score.
