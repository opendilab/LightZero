![pipeline](assets/lightzero_overview.png)

LightZero is a library with a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithms such as:
- [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265)
- [EfficientZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00210)
- [Sampled MuZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06303)
